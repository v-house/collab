          What is Collab@IITH?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-center">
          Collab@IITH is an exclusive platform created for the IITH Community to
          foster collaboration. It provides a space where individuals and teams
          can collaborate on a wide range of projects, including both formal and
          informal initiatives. Whether you need a cricket team for the
          college's next DIESTA cricket tournament, a team for participating in
          a hackathon outside IITH, a dance crew for the freshers party, or a
          prom partner for the next prom night, Collab@IITH can help you find
          the right people. Just make sure to submit your project details in a
          timely manner to ensure maximum participation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-center mt-4">
          Why Collab@IITH? It brings everything together in one place, allowing
          you to showcase your project details in the best possible way and
          efficiently manage collaborators. It serves as the initial phase of
          interest-based project selection, helping you find the right
          individuals for your project.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-center mt-4">
          Why not use other collaboration platforms? By using Collab@IITH, you
          can effectively publicize your project to reach individuals with the
          expertise and interest you require. Furthermore, providing
          opportunities to the IITH Community benefits everyone involved. It
          promotes the growth of our own college community and enables personal
          offline communication with potential collaborators. Additionally, you
          can explore and discover a wide range of available projects, gaining
          insights from diverse perspectives.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-center mt-4">
          So why wait? If you need someone to join your team, go ahead and hire
          them. If you're interested in contributing to active projects,
          collaborate with other ongoing initiatives. Let's collaborate, work
          together, and grow as a community.
